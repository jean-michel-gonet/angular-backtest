<h2>How should I invest during bear periods?</h2>
<p>Rough waters are for skilled sailors. During bear periods is best to
  tuck away your portfolio, and wait for friendlier times.</p>
<p>Or is it?</p>

<h3>Use AGG to have some return</h3>
<p>This is a simulation with the following components:</p>
<ul>
  <li>During Bull periods, invest in a fund tracking the S&amp;P500</li>
  <li>During Bear periods, invest in the <em>Aggregated Bonds USA</em>.</li>
  <li>Use different market timing to discriminate between Bull and Bear</li>
  <li>Start in 1996 with USD 100.000, and end in 2020.</li>
</ul>
